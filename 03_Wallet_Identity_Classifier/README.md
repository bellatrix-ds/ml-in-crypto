# ðŸ’¼ Wallet Identity Classifier
This Streamlit dashboard leverages unsupervised machine-learning techniques to automatically profile and classify Ethereum wallets by analyzing on-chain behavioral patternsâ€”transaction timing, value distribution, and smart-contract interactions. By extracting key features from wallet activity and applying clustering algorithms, it reveals distinct user types (e.g., individual holders, automated bots, or service accounts) and provides interactive visualizations for exploring their characteristic behaviors. Ideal for researchers and analysts, the Wallet Behavior Dashboard makes it easy to uncover hidden insights in large-scale blockchain data without writing any custom code.
